        <p>"And finally, this question: The mystery of who’s story it will be. Of who draws the curtain.
            Who is it that chooses our steps in the dance? Who drives us mad, lashes us with whips and 
            crowns us with victory when we survive the impossible? Who is it that does all these things? 
            Who honours those we love with the very life we live? Who sends monsters to kill us and at 
            the same time sings that we will never die? Who teaches us whats real and how to laugh at lies?
             Who decides why we live and what We’ll die to defend? Who chains us? And who holds the Key 
             that can set us free?
            <br>
            <br>
            It’s <strong>You</strong>.
            <br>
            
            You have all the weapons you need.
